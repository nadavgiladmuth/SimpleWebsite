    Hi! My name is Nadav Gilad-Muth, and I am a sophomore at Haverford College. I am majoring in Environmental Studies and minoring in Data Science. I am currently the co-head of Haverford's Ornithological Club and I lead weekly birding walks every weekend! I have been birdwatching since I was little, and my love for observing birds has only grown over the years. I enjoy observing different species of birds and just about any living creature I get the oppurtunity to see in the wild! I regularly upload my observations to my <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&user_id=ngiladmuth&verifiable=any" target="_blank">iNaturalist profile</a>, where I share my findings and contribute to the global community of nature enthusiasts and researchers.</p>
